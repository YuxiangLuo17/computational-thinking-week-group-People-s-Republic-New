"""
Station 3
---------
Fill in `solution_station_3` to implement the algorithm you infer from the station's sample inputs/outputs.

Tips:
- Keep the function pure (no prints, no I/O). 
- Return the exact type expected in main.py (see asserts).
- You may use built-in modules + numpy/pandas if helpful.
